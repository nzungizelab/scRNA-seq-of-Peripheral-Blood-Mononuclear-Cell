# scRNA-seq-of-Peripheral-Blood-Mononuclear-Cell

Main： visualization possibilities such as Scatter plots （UMAP and t-SNE)，using known marker genes to identify clusters and differentially expressed genes.

scRNA-seq technology have resulted in a wealth of studies aiming to identify transcriptomic cell types in various biological systems.
Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a powerful tool to study heterogeneity and dynamic changes in cell populations
Dataset used Fresh 68k PBMCs (Donor A)
